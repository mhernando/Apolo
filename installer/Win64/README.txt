README for the APOLO Robot Simulator 
______________________

Apolo is a simple but powerful free and open software for simulate and learn robotics. 
It is being used by a large number of professors and researchers.

Because it is based on the MRCore library and the wxWidgets, it is portable to several software platforms including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X.
The last contribution to the Simulator is a generic TCP/IP port with a simple and fast protocol, allowing the development of planning or control algorithms in other languages. Especially significant is the Apolo Toolbox Components that allows the direct connection between Matlab and Apolo.


Both MRCore and Apolo, is being developed at MRGroup, at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. The Mobile Robotics Group is part of the CAR, the reference centre on Robotics and Automatics of Madrid where most relevant researchers on this area work in Madrid (Spain).

The intaller includes the MFCs and glut libs. Only install them if needed.
