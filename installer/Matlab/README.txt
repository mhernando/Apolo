For using the apolo Toolbox, add the path to the current directory to Matlab Search Path.
This could be done through the command:

>>addpath('directory')

Or interactively through the Search Path Dialog.

Check that apolo commands are included executing:

>>apoloUpdate

with any instance of apolo running.
